# Rule Changes

ER-001 through ER-010 use the audit date **2026-07-30**; ER-011 uses **2026-07-31**.
Canonical rule edits are made only under `sources/rules/`; generated products are rebuilt and
independently validated after each batch.

## ER-001 — Canonical-source migration

**Type:** infrastructure, zero-behavior migration

- Added an ordered 43-segment manifest, 42 ordered proxy groups, a sanitized base, and 42
  canonical rule files.
- Preserved the two non-contiguous music segments as `music` and `music-2`.
- Removed the credential-bearing expanded profile from the normal generation and validation path.
- Added deterministic clean staging, directory replacement, `--check`, and SHA-256 product
  manifest generation.
- Fixed `analysis.json` so `music` and `music-2` report per-segment rule types instead of a merged
  target-level count.

## ER-002 — Same-segment exact deduplication

**Type:** mechanical, no first-match behavior change

Removed 143 later occurrences of text-identical rules within the same physical segment. The first
occurrence and segment order were retained. No cross-segment deduplication was performed.

| Segment | Removed |
|---|---:|
| `global-web` | 86 |
| `emby` | 43 |
| `hbo-go` | 7 |
| `media-taiwan` | 3 |
| `hbo-max` | 2 |
| `game-download` | 1 |
| `media-japan` | 1 |

## ER-003 — Invalid CIDRs and generated sentinels

**Type:** deterministic error removal

Deleted rather than guessed corrected prefixes:

- `emby`: `IP-CIDR,161.97.148.156/24,no-resolve`
- `global-web`: `IP-CIDR,108.168.174.0/16,no-resolve`
- `global-web`: `IP-CIDR,174.37.243.0/16,no-resolve`
- `global-web`: `IP-CIDR,75.126.150.0/16,no-resolve`
- `global-web`: `IP-CIDR,69.171.235.0/16,no-resolve`

The addresses have host bits set for their declared prefix. The four `global-web` entries came
from a historical WhatsApp/SoftLayer block; changing them to a guessed network would broaden
shared-cloud routing without evidence.

Also deleted `DOMAIN-SUFFIX,gfwlist.start` and `DOMAIN-SUFFIX,gfwlist.end`. ACL4SSR used these as
historical generated-section sentinels; they are not service domains.

- <https://github.com/ACL4SSR/ACL4SSR/commit/4b560dd2574b57d58f3467a43ec99974865ff002>

## ER-004 — High-confidence defunct or misclassified domains

**Type:** deterministic stale-rule removal

| Segment | Removed rule | Reason and evidence |
|---|---|---|
| `music-2` | `DOMAIN-SUFFIX,spotilocal.com` | Spotify's historical local WebHelper API was removed around 2017; current maintained source comparisons no longer support it. |
| `music-2` | `DOMAIN,spotify.map.fastly.net` | The exact naked mapping name is not the active Spotify hostname; live traffic uses child names such as `atc.spotify.map.fastly.net`, which an exact `DOMAIN` rule never matched. |
| `music-2` | `DOMAIN,spotify.map.fastlylb.net` | Defunct exact hostname; no current Spotify/Fastly operating evidence was found. |
| `music-2` | `DOMAIN-SUFFIX,static-qobuz.com` | Defunct static domain; current Qobuz assets use other hosts. |
| `global-web` | `DOMAIN-SUFFIX,azubu.tv` | Azubu and Hitbox were merged and relaunched as Smashcast in 2017. |
| `global-web` | `DOMAIN-SUFFIX,spring.net` | Current domain is an unrelated Web3 platform; Java Spring uses `spring.io`. |
| `global-web` | `DOMAIN-SUFFIX,ocnttv.com` | Historical TV domain has been repurposed for unrelated content. |

- <https://spring.io/projects/spring-framework/>

The uncertain `pscdn.co`, community services, and transient DNS/HTTP failures remain review items;
they were not removed by this change.

## ER-005 — Redundant Spotify keywords

**Type:** precision correction

Removed from `music-2`:

- `DOMAIN-KEYWORD,-spotify-`
- `DOMAIN-KEYWORD,spotify.com`

The exact Spotify suffixes remain. The keywords were redundant for valid Spotify domains and also
matched unrelated names such as `foo-spotify-bar.example` or `spotify.com.attacker.example`.

## ER-006 — Historical Google QA/Qualys hosts

**Type:** high-confidence stale-rule removal

Removed all 24 combinations of these host prefixes and zones from `google`:

- prefixes: `distribution`, `download`, `monitoring`, `qagpublic`, `qgadmin`, `qualysapi`,
  `qualysguard`, `scanservice1`
- zones: `qatp1.net`, `qcpp1.net`, `qpdp1.net`

The audit found consistent NXDOMAIN results, no usable HTTP/TLS endpoint, and upstream deletion in
2025–2026. These historical enterprise QA/Qualys names were not current Google service domains.

Evidence:

- <https://github.com/v2fly/domain-list-community/commit/23e6b743e1fa9277aa346ebb6eae9d6aebd24f23>
- <https://github.com/v2fly/domain-list-community/commit/8dc538dce9bcdd5650c2dcbce077c44ac44f5a28>

## ER-007 — Stale fixed cloud IPs

**Type:** precision and tenant-reuse correction

Removed all local occurrences of:

- `104.154.127.126/32`
- `35.186.224.47/32`
- `52.211.1.180/32`
- `99.81.97.56/32`

The first two were historical Spotify bindings in shared Google Cloud space and had drifted;
`35.186.224.47` showed a different tenant identity. The latter two were old/shared AWS addresses
without a current exclusive Qobuz relationship. Fixed shared-cloud IPs are not stable service
identifiers.

Evidence:

- <https://rdap.arin.net/registry/ip/104.154.127.126>
- <https://rdap.arin.net/registry/ip/35.186.224.47>
- <https://ipinfo.io/52.211.1.180>
- <https://ipinfo.io/99.81.97.56>

## ER-008 — Overbroad regional and keyword routing

**Type:** first-match behavior correction

Removed from early specialized segments:

- Japan media: `DOMAIN-SUFFIX,jp`, `DOMAIN-KEYWORD,.jp`, `DOMAIN-KEYWORD,ntt`
- Korea media: `DOMAIN-SUFFIX,kr`, `DOMAIN-KEYWORD,.kr`
- Taiwan media: `DOMAIN-KEYWORD,friday`

Behavior changes:

| Input | Before | After |
|---|---|---|
| `example.jp` | `media-japan` via `.jp` | `global-web` via `jp` |
| `example.kr` | `media-korea` via `.kr` | `global-web` via `kr` |
| `blackfridaysale.example` | `media-taiwan` via keyword | FINAL |
| `unrelated-ntt.example` | `media-japan` via keyword | FINAL |
| `video.friday.tw` | `media-taiwan` | unchanged via exact service suffix |

## ER-009 — Shared infrastructure moved out of specialized policies

**Type:** first-match behavior correction

Removed shared roots from earlier specialized segments while keeping explicit service hosts:

- bare `hinet.net` from Taiwan media, Bahamut, and global media;
- bare `gvt1.com`/`gvt2.com` from Bahamut, YouTube, and global media;
- bare `sentry.io` from Claude and Dazn;
- `players.brightcove.net` and `edge.api.brightcove.com` from specialized media segments;
- shared AWS ranges `18.194.0.0/15`, `34.224.0.0/12`, `54.242.0.0/15` from Messaging;
- shared GCP range `35.192.0.0/12` from Game Platform.

Added general `global-web` suffixes for `sentry.io`, `players.brightcove.net`, and
`edge.api.brightcove.com`. Existing `global-web` rules already handled bare HiNet, GVT, and the
three AWS ranges. The GCP range was not rebound to another service and now falls through to FINAL.

Representative behavior:

| Input | Before | After |
|---|---|---|
| `mail.hinet.net` | Taiwan media | global web |
| `theater-kktv.cdn.hinet.net` | Taiwan media via bare HiNet | Taiwan media via exact KKTV host |
| `download.gvt1.com` | Bahamut/YouTube shared root | global web |
| `redirector.gvt1.com` | shared root | Google explicit subdomain |
| `app.sentry.io` | Claude | global web |
| `players.brightcove.net` | Japan/HBO shared host | global web |
| `18.194.1.1` | Messaging | global web |
| `34.224.1.1` | Messaging | global web |
| `54.242.1.1` | Messaging | global web |
| `35.192.1.1` | Game Platform | FINAL |

## ER-010 — Generation and importer safety hardening

**Type:** tooling safety, portability, and fail-closed validation

- Existing output directories are replaced only when a valid Ekko Rules manifest and all recorded
  SHA-256 hashes prove ownership; arbitrary directories are never overwritten.
- `--check` and validation now detect unexpected empty directories as well as files.
- Published URLs reject userinfo, fragments, sensitive query parameters, and paths that do not
  match the configured GitHub repository.
- Proxy-provider paths are fixed portable relative paths; Windows and POSIX absolute paths are
  rejected.
- `mixed-port` rejects booleans and values outside 1–65535.
- Full `analysis.json` content is independently recomputed and compared, including when the
  optional generation check is skipped.
- The legacy importer requires a final standalone MATCH, rejects partial-node groups that would
  broaden to all subscription nodes, writes through clean staging, and leaves no partial output on
  failure.
- `.gitattributes` forces LF for canonical and generated text on Windows and Linux.
- Regression coverage increased from 11 to 20 tests, including mutation and failure-path tests.

## ER-011 — Phase 2 scoped classification

**Type:** product split, service classification, and first-match precision correction

- Added explicit `core` and `optional` scope to every segment and policy group.
- Split Messaging into LINE, Kakao, WhatsApp, and Telegram without changing their shared policy.
- Split music into Tidal, Spotify, Qobuz, and Apple Music. Optional Spotify legacy and Qobuz
  brand-defense entries remain in their original relative positions in Extended.
- Added minimal AI, social, and developer policies, plus a `private` ruleset targeting `DIRECT`.
- Moved Emby community, personal/community, and historical-streaming preferences out of Core.
- Moved shared OpenAI/Claude dependencies to global routing and removed shared CDN roots from
  `global-media`; service-specific CDN hosts remain specialized.
- Removed 23 occurrences only when they were covered duplicates, overbroad keywords, shared
  misclassification, or residual copies of stale entries already approved in ER-004.
- Preserved Apple/Google aggregate rules pending separate complete line-by-line brand-defense and
  legacy migrations; Phase 2 does not claim that work is complete.
- Hardened the release gates after adversarial review: Core/Extended scope metrics are now frozen,
  YAML/JSON duplicate keys and symbolic links are rejected, known credential formats are scanned,
  every Subconverter control is checked even without regeneration, and Legacy importer output now
  completes the standard generate/validate chain.

Behavior examples:

| Input | Before | Core after | Extended after |
|---|---|---|---|
| `10.0.0.1` | China web | DIRECT private | DIRECT private |
| `cursor.com` | Global web | AI services | AI services |
| `github.com` | Global web keyword | Developer services | Developer services |
| `line.me` | Messaging | LINE slug / same policy | LINE slug / same policy |
| `pscdn.co` | Music | Global media fallback | Spotify legacy / Music |
| `pub1.emby.wtf` | EMBY | FINAL | Emby community / EMBY |
| `statsig.com` | OpenAI | Global web | Global web |
| `storage.googleapis.com` | Claude | Google | Google |
| `example.amazonaws.com` | Global media | Global web | Global web |
| `dcalivedazn.akamaized.net` | DAZN | DAZN | DAZN |

Migration closure is frozen in `tests/fixtures/phase-2-migration-ledger.json`:

```text
15,540 old file rules = 15,517 Extended + 23 explicit removals
15,517 Extended = 15,411 Core + 106 optional
```

## Current verified result

- Core: 51 rule files, 52 ordered segments, 44 proxy groups, 15,412 rules including FINAL
- Extended: 57 rule files, 58 ordered segments, 45 proxy groups, 15,518 rules including FINAL
- 2,205 destination-IP rules in both products, all with `no-resolve`
- zero same-segment exact duplicates and zero non-strict CIDRs
- Core first-match unreachable union: 2,377; same-segment: 937; cross-segment-only: 1,440
- Extended first-match unreachable union: 2,449; same-segment: 1,009; cross-segment-only: 1,440
